# Autonomous-Agent-Environment
**Autonomous-Agent-Environment** is a 2D simulation project built using **Raylib**. The environment features customizable autonomous agents that navigate and interact with a dynamic world using AI-inspired behaviors. It provides a platform for experimenting with movement algorithms, environment interaction, and multi-agent systems in a visually appealing and interactive way.

## **Features**

- **Agent Behaviors**:  
  - **Seek**: Agents move toward designated targets.  
  - **Flee**: Agents avoid specific objects or threats.  
  - **Wander**: Agents exhibit randomized, natural movements.  
  - **Arrive**: Agents slow down and stop when reaching their targets.  

- **Dynamic Environment**: Includes obstacles, targets, and power-ups that influence agent behavior.  
- **Multi-Agent Interaction**: Observe agents working individually or in groups with varying behaviors.  
- **Real-Time Updates**: Interact with the environment and see immediate effects on agents.  
- **Customizability**: Adjustable agent properties such as speed, perception radius, and behavior parameters.

## **How to Use**

1. **Run the Program**: Compile and run the project in **Raylib** (C++).  
2. **Observe Agents**: Watch agents as they autonomously navigate the environment.  
3. **Modify Settings**:  
   - Adjust agent parameters like maximum speed or behavior type.  
   - Add or remove obstacles and targets in the simulation.  
4. **Experiment**: Test how agents respond to various challenges and scenarios.

- **Programming Language**: C++  
- **Algorithms**: Steering behaviors for AI movement.  
- **Visuals**: Minimalistic 2D graphics rendered in real-time.
